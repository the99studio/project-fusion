### Initial Release

Project Fusion is a CLI tool that merges multiple project files into a single file for easy sharing and collaboration. This initial release provides multiple output formats.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **CLI interface** built with Commander.js
  - Command-line options for dynamic configuration overrides
  - Simple command structure: `project-fusion`, `project-fusion init`, `project-fusion config-check`
  - Version and help commands
- **Configuration system** with JSON schema validation using Zod
  - Automatic configuration generation with `init` command
  - Customizable ignore patterns with .gitignore integration
  - File extension support (35+ extensions) organized by category
- **Multi-format output generation** - Supports .txt, .md, and .html formats
  - HTML (.html) with responsive design and navigation
  - Markdown (.md) with syntax highlighting and table of contents
  - Plain text (.txt) with file separators

#### File Extension Support (38 extensions)
- **Backend Languages**: .cs, .go, .java, .php, .py, .rb, .rs
- **C/C++**: .c, .cc, .cpp, .h, .hpp
- **Configuration**: .json, .toml, .xml, .yaml, .yml
- **Documentation**: .adoc, .md, .rst
- **Godot Engine**: .cfg, .cs, .gd, .import, .tscn, .tres
- **Scripts**: .bat, .cmd, .ps1, .sh
- **Web Development**: .css, .html, .js, .jsx, .svelte, .ts, .tsx, .vue

#### APIs and Integration
- **File system adapters** - Abstraction layer with memory and disk implementations
- **Fluent API** - Chainable interface for configuration (`projectFusion().include(['web']).generate()`)
- **Memory management** - Built-in memory usage tracking and limits
- **Output strategies** - Pluggable output format system (Text, Markdown, HTML)
- **Plugin system** - Extensible architecture with hooks for custom processing
- **Programmatic API** - Use Project Fusion in other applications with progress reporting
- **VS Code Extension Support** - Progress callbacks and cancellation tokens for IDE integration

#### Technical Features  
- **Branded types** (FilePath) for type-safe path handling
- **Clipboard integration** with automatic fallback for CI environments
- **Content validation** - Detects base64 blocks >2KB, tokens >2000 chars, lines >5000 chars
- **Discriminated unions** for error handling (FusionResult)
- **Error handling** with FusionError class, error codes, and severity levels
- **Node.js 20.10+ requirement** for enhanced performance and features
- **Performance tracking** - BenchmarkTracker for metrics and optimization
- **Secret redaction** - Automatic detection and masking of sensitive information
- **TypeScript 5.9.2** with strict mode and ESM modules

#### Testing and Quality
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with Vitest - 20+ test suites
- **Error boundaries** and failure handling
- **ESLint v9** flat configuration with strict rules
- **Memory filesystem testing** for isolated unit tests
- **Modular architecture** with separation of concerns
- **Performance benchmarks** - Resource limit and throughput tests
- **Property-based testing** with fast-check for edge cases
- **SPDX license headers** in all source files

#### Configuration Features
- **Custom ignore patterns** with glob support
- **Default values** with fallback configuration
- **gitignore integration** with automatic .gitignore parsing
- **Preview mode** - List files without generating output
- **Resource limits** - File size, file count, and total size limits
- **Schema versioning** for future compatibility
- **Subdirectory parsing** control

### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture** with separation between CLI, fusion logic, and utilities
- **Automatic generated file exclusion** - Prevents including fusion outputs in new fusions
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **File scanning** with glob patterns and ignore filtering
- **File size limits** configurable per project
- **Streaming support** for large file processing
- **Zod validation** for configuration validation with schema versioning

### Security Features
- **Binary file detection** - Automatic detection and skipping of binary files using null byte analysis
- **Comprehensive security testing** - 20+ security tests covering all attack vectors
- **Content validation** - Strict validation for base64, token length, and line length limits
- **Path traversal protection** - All file paths validated to remain within root directory
- **Plugin security** - External plugin loading disabled by default, path validation for plugin files
- **Safe error handling** - Security-related errors logged without exposing sensitive path information
- **Secret exclusion** - Automatic detection and redaction of API keys, tokens, and passwords
- **Symbolic link protection** - Symlinks detected and blocked by default, configurable via `allowSymlinks`
- **XSS prevention** - All HTML output properly escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
